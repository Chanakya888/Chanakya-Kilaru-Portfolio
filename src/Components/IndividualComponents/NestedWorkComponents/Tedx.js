            I am personally very attached to TEDxBMU, TEDxBMU was the first
            event that I participated after joining the university back in 2017.
            I worked as a video editor for the first two TEDxBMUs, after which I
            worked with my seniors in organising the annual TEDx in 2019. I
            learnt professional video editing using Final Cut Pro X and making
            animations for promotions and intro for the videos, I was exposed to
            all the rigorous work that goes into editing a video, watching the
            video multiple times, syncing two cameras and an external audio.
