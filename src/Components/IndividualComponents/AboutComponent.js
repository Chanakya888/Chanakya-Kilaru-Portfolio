          I am a third year student pursuing B.Tech. degree in Computer Science
          from BML Munjal University, Gurgaon. founded by The Hero Group and
          mentored by Imperial College, London.

          I have always been interested in human centred design to solve
          emerging issues in my surroundings and this is what I would want to
          continue exploring and pursue in greater depths upon my graduation

          I feel that being from a computer science background, I was exposed to
          understanding complex algorithms and applying them. This exposure
          makes my design more reasonable and creative. Being able to understand
          design, my development can be more clear and delightful.
